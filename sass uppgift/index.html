                Microsoft's last big game developer acquisition happened six years ago with the purchase of Mojang
                , the maker of the block-like Minecraft game, for $2.5 billion.
                 That deal was notable at the time for being one of Microsoft's biggest purchases.

                A Minecraft server is a player-owned or business-owned multiplayer game server for the 2009 Mojang video game Minecraft
                . Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators,
                 who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players.
